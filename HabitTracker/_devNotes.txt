🎯 Functional Requirements
User sees a list of habits on the main screen.
Each habit displays:
Title (e.g., "Drink Water")
Number of times completed (optional for now)
Show a message like “No habits yet” if the list is empty.
🛠️ Technical Requirements
Set up a SwiftUI app project in Xcode.
Define a Habit model (simple struct for now).
Use @State to store a temporary list of habits.
Build a List or ScrollView UI for displaying habits.

A nice list UI that shows habit names (hardcoded or dynamic is fine).
Message for when there are no habits.
